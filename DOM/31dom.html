<!-- 
In browser, go to inspect -> console and write console.log(window), i will get many attributes related to my window
next i can write console.log(window.document ) or just console.log(document), I will get some object model of the page
to get document attributes just like window, i can write console.dir(document)
console.log(document.(u get endless amount of properties after this)) we can choose any property
for eg, console.log(document.links)=> gives all the links in that html page, this is an array(not really an array but just like that)
console.log(document.links[2]) will give is the 2nd link that is on the webpage

documet.getElementById("anything").innerHTML="whatever"
basically the above line allows us to manipulate the text displayed on the webpage
